Modem talking, modern walking in the streets

New desire, take me higher,

Lift me higher with your speed

I need fire

Get the satellite if you want to see me

Talking on the net, I know the way you like it

Get your credit card, 'cause I need no money,

All I wanna get is you baby

Running in the 90s, is a new way I like to be

I'm just running in the 90s, come on baby run to me

We are running in the 90s, is a new way to set me free
