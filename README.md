Well, you can hide a lot about yourself
but, honey, what are you gonna do?
And you can sleep in a coffin, but the past ain't through with you
'Cause we are all a bunch of liars, tell me, baby, who do you wanna be?
And we are all about to sell it, 'cause it's tragic with a capital T
Let it be, let it be, let it be
